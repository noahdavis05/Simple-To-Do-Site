# Django To Do List Application
Welcome to my first Django project! This application is a simple To-Do List and Shopping List website, developed as part of my learning journey into Django and back-end development.

## Overview
I built this project to try and grasp the fundamentals of Django, with the aim to build more exciting projects in the future. The application consists of:
- User Authentication: Sign-up, login, and logout functionality.
- To-Do List: Users can create, update, and manage tasks, with options to progress or mark tasks as completed.
- Shopping List: Users can create a shopping list, adding or removing items as needed.

## Try it out
You can explore the live version of the app at noahdavis05.pythonanywhere.com.

Note: The site is hosted for 3 months at a time, so if the link isn't working, I might have forgotten to renew the hosting.
